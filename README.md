Comments: Thank you Jefferson and Caitlin and all the other TAs for all the helpful guides and advice throughout the project. Special shoutouts to Jefferson for linking [his group's repository](https://gitlab.com/forbesye/fitsbits) and Caitlin for linking [her group's repository](https://gitlab.com/caitlinlien/cs373-sustainability/). We referenced these repositories for general ideas, such as organizing code, as well as a few specific points: namely the GitLab CI, Dockerfile, axios backend calls to GitLab, and Google maps API.
